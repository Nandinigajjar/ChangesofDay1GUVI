Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. There are two primary versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods, while IPv6 addresses are longer and consist of eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.

Port:
A port is a communication endpoint in a network that is used to identify a specific process or service on a host. Ports allow multiple network services to operate on a single host, distinguishing between different types of traffic. Ports are identified by a number ranging from 0 to 65535. Ports from 0 to 1023 are reserved for well-known services, while ports from 1024 to 49151 are registered ports used by specific applications, and ports from 49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports.

HTTP Methods (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Methods):
HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The primary HTTP methods are:

GET: Retrieves data from the server.
POST: Submits data to be processed by the server.
PUT: Updates an existing resource or creates a new resource.
DELETE: Removes a resource from the server.
PATCH: Partially updates a resource.
HEAD: Retrieves metadata about a resource without fetching the resource itself.
OPTIONS: Requests information about the communication options available for a resource.
These HTTP methods define the semantics of interactions between clients and servers in web-based systems.

MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC addresses are assigned by the manufacturer of the network interface and are used for addressing and delivering data packets within a network. MAC addresses are typically expressed as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for anyone working with computer networks, web development, or network administration. Each plays a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange across the internet and local networks.
